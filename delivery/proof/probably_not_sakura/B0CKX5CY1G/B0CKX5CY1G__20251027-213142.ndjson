I use a small amount twice daily—with gentle taps around the eye area—and it immediately feels soothing and hydrating. It doesn’t sting or irritate, even on skin that is sensitive or prone to dryness.\n\nWhat impresses me most is how it subtly firms and brightens over time. The blend of collagen, hyaluronic acid, and Jericho Rose extract makes the skin feel more resilient and nourished. I’ve noticed puffiness in the mornings is more controlled, and those mild fine lines I had at the outer eye area appear less noticeable. The skin under my eyes also looks a touch more awake and even-toned.\n\nAnother benefit is that it layers well with other products—whether I’m using a serum or moisturizer, the eye cream sits comfortably beneath without causing any pilling. It’s fragrance-free and gentle, which suits my sensitive skin well.\n\nWhile it’s not a dramatic anti-aging fix, it’s clearly working to maintain hydration and bounce in the delicate under-eye area. Over time, the overall result is a fresher, smoother look. If you’re looking for a calming, non-irritating cream to help with mild puffiness, texture, and early signs of aging under the eyes, this is worth trying.\n\nOverall, the Abib Collagen Eye Crème Jericho Rose tube feels like a thoughtful, effective treat for the under-eye zone. It helps with softness, subtle firmness, and sustained hydration—great for everyday maintenance or delicate skin in need of a gentle pick-me-up.\n\n続きを読む","bodyLength":1763,"ratingText":"5つ星のうち5.0","collectedAt":"2025-10-27T12:31:43.561477100Z"}

But what this eye cream does for me I am more than satisfied with. I only use this once a day, in the morning. I take about 1/2 a pea size and tap in lightly under my eyes and under my eyebrow. I find this cream thick, it blends in easily and very moisturizing. I don't have under eye dark circles, but I do have some puffiness. I cannot say this cream does away with the puffiness, but I have days that they look \"better\". I do find that this cream softens my lines and wrinkles so they are not as obvious. I have sensitive skin but have had no irritation and my sunscreen applies nicely over this. I have bought and used more expensive eye creams from makeup counters and I find that this product does as well, if not better at a much, much more affordable price point. And you get a huge amount for the money! I will reorder this product again.","bodyLength":955,"ratingText":"5つ星のうち5.0","collectedAt":"2025-10-27T12:31:43.561477100Z"}
