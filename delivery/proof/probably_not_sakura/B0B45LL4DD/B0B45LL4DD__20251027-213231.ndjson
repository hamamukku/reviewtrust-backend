It feels so lightweight yet deeply nourishing. Whenever I use it, my under-eye area looks more refreshed, and over time, I’ve noticed a visible reduction in fine lines. The ginseng gives my skin that extra boost of hydration and vitality, while the retinal helps with anti-aging. I apply it both morning and night, and it layers perfectly with the rest of my skincare. It’s a must-have for anyone looking to brighten and smooth the eye area!","bodyLength":546,"ratingText":"5つ星のうち5.0","collectedAt":"2025-10-27T12:32:33.069361400Z"}

My under-eye area tends to look tired and puffy, especially in the mornings, but this serum has made a noticeable difference in brightness, firmness, and smoothness.\n\nThe texture is silky and lightweight, and it absorbs beautifully without feeling greasy or heavy. I love that it combines ginseng, known for its revitalizing and nourishing properties, with retinal, a gentler form of retinoid that’s great for sensitive skin. It delivers all the anti-aging benefits without irritation, dryness, or peeling.\n\nAfter regular use, I’ve noticed a reduction in the appearance of fine lines and a more even tone around my eyes. My concealer also applies more smoothly, which is a bonus I didn’t expect! A little goes a long way, so this 30ml bottle will definitely last.","bodyLength":898,"ratingText":"5つ星のうち5.0","collectedAt":"2025-10-27T12:32:33.069361400Z"}
