The packaging makes this facewash ideal for on the go as it is light and not bulky to carry. It does stand up on it's own, it doesn't need to be laid down or propped up, so if you do want to keep it in the bathroom then that should be fine too. I find the name of this facewash a bit misleading, as I thought Bulk would mean that it was a very large size, as in buying in bulk, but it certainly doesn't mean that at all, this facewash is only 100g, far from bulk buying. It is very thick and creamy, you use a cherry sized amount, lather it up and wash your face. It has a very delicate aroma, maybe passion fruit, I'm not sure, and feels gentle on the skin. I'm not a man, obviously, but it felt nice on my skin too, not drying and didn't make my skin feel tight; my son likes it, but if he didn't I'd be happy to use it as a wet wash on occasion. The only problem is the price, I find £17.55 (at the time of writing) quite expensive and since I still buy my son's facewash I'm not sure I would spend this much on it, I'll be making him buy his own if wants to continue with this one, lol!","bodyLength":1220,"ratingText":"5つ星のうち4.0","collectedAt":"2025-10-27T10:53:59.346846800Z"}

I enjoy using the product. Face feels different after using this compared to other products. Less of the 'oily' feeling. I have sensitive skin, been using this for 3 months, no problems compared to my previous products.\n\nThe packaging is awkward, it looks fine but the pouches don't stand well. They topple over on their own. The amount is also not ideal. In asia, they sell a travel sized kit for their fash wash line. This 3.5 ounce container is too big for TSA carry on limit. I wish they would have a size option that fits within TSA limits and a large option. Something like 6 ounces.","bodyLength":645,"ratingText":"5つ星のうち5.0","collectedAt":"2025-10-27T10:53:59.346846800Z"}

I've had particular issues with dryness under my beard, particularly when wearing a mask, but this helped (but did not completely) alleviate that issue.\n\nThe cleanser foams well and is very easy to wash out of my beard and off my face. It has a slight vanilla scent that is noticeable to the user just when washing and very shortly (minutes) thereafter; after washing, my wife did not notice it unless smelling my beard it","bodyLength":654,"ratingText":"5つ星のうち4.0","collectedAt":"2025-10-27T10:53:59.346846800Z"}
